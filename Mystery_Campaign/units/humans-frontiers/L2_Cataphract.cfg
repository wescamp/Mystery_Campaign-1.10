    description= _ "Without infantry to back up border patrols, cavalrymen often have trouble holding off organised attacks. Some veterans therefore choose to protect themselves with heavy armour covering themselves and their horses. Their armour even serves as some protection against arrows and spears that horses and normally so vulnerable to, and their weapons deal the most fearsome damage. However, the armour weighs them down, and on hillsides they become easy targets."
