"\n"
"    During most of the Golden Age, the humans who inhabited the Great "
"Continent were mostly Wesnothians, divided across various territories such "
"as the Northlands, Elensefar and the kingdom of Wesnoth itself. However, "
"there was once a time of great strife during which a new race of humans "
"started to appear from nowhere. They were the 'Aragwaithi', which meant "
"'noble' in their native language.\n"
"\n"
"    It has been since then rumored that they came from the Vast Sea to "
"settle in Wesnoth. They mostly lived as mercenaries in that time, until the "
"Fall. After that, they supposedly moved to the northmost lands of the "
"Continent, were the sands could not reach, and the green could survive.\n"
"\n"
"    Albeit being humans, many of their customs and racial features are "
"incredibly different to the standards, to the point it puts them close to "
"elves in terms of their dexterity with bows. Their wisemen have a mastery of "
"magic not to be underestimated in the battlefield, for it has surprised and "
"overseded the best magi often."

"    The humans of the Khalifate are regular ones, proud and sturdy, but have "
"not had much contact with the people of Wesnoth.\n"
"\n"
"    <header>text='Geography'</header>\n"
"    Few is known to the cartographers of Wesnoth south of the Aethenwoods "
"and only one known living, an Elf named Eliel, have ever travelled towards "
"the Khalifate and come back. He spout about forests so thick that the sun "
"cannot reach the ground, waste deserts greater than the ocean and mountains "
"that touch the sky. Nobody believed him.\n"
"\n"
"    <header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"    The Khalifate are a semi-nomadic folk who occasionally found trading "
"cities at the cost or send caravans through the desert for contacting their "
"neighbours, but mostly hale in various small tribes scattered across the "
"country only unified together by the Khalif of Tyrkyeh.\n"
"\n"
"    <header>text='Legends'</header>\n"
"    In the beliefs of those nomads the world is ruled by two primordial "
"forces in perpetual war and perfect symbiosis: Light and Darkness. While "
"night and death are to be feared, they are not evil and neither faction can, "
"or should, ever triumph. Every member of the Khalifate choose their "
"following path joining one of the forces.\n"
"\n"
"    Legends passed down through many generations do speak of a time when "
"there was a great evil. The name of this evil has been forgotten, for the "
"older generations were reluctant to utter it. The evil was motivated by "
"neither chaos nor death, but rather the complete annihilation of all. Both "
"forces of the world united to defeat this evil, splitting it into two "
"components much like they themselves were divided.  One half was a cold, "
"lifeless, and listless force that bore a strong resemblance to death. The "
"other half was passionate and full of life, but lacked direction and was "
"much weakened without the cold logic of the other half. The enemy was now "
"split into components that fit within the understanding of the world; it was "
"of this world, and could not carry out its original mission.\n"
"\n"
"    Eventually, one day a faction will arouse victorious and annihilate the "
"other and itself in the process."

"a world into which they were cast. They added to their knowledge of the "
"arcane arts, the dark ones. And through this they have wrought a thriving "
"underground society full of armies, cities, and a ruling queen.\n"
"\n"
"    They live in shadows, content to be ignored by the world of light above "
"them, in fact, it is not even sure if they know it.\n"
"    Only the Dwarves, and some more obscure cave creatures, have knowledge "
"of them, by sending scouting parties deep into the caves in search of gold, "
"shiny stones, sturdy metals. Quickly droved, but few returned to their great "
"halls unscathed. Those that did spout incoherent babble, and amongst their "

"\n"
"    <header>text='History'</header>\n"
"    Long after the Fall, when the suns dried out the marches and the forests "
"diminished, every man or beast was on his own. The Trolls budded deeper into "
"the ancients mountains, the dwarves retreated themselves into long forgotten "
"reigns, the orcs hided into muddy holes and undead roamed the known lands.\n"
"\n"
"    While the elfes, well, slowly they had gain an affinity with the vast "
"deserts that spread out in this new era. Even forgetting most of their "
"ancestors memories or misinterpreting them, they lived in peace despite "
"lacking the skills or civilisation's acknowledgements of their foregoing "
"being known afterwards as 'the Quenoth Elfs'.\n"
"\n"
"    But not all stayed at the surface and fought a desperate fight against "
"destiny, some elfes, overcoming their own fear of darkness and the "
"underground, fled deep inside the mountains of Irdya. In the beginning, life "
"was treacherous and dangerous into the depths, and many civilians have "
"perished to the unknown foes of the underworld. But with time, strength was "
"born and those elfs forged a labyrinthine tunnels, a waste empire, whose "
"centre was the magnificent elfish capital of Valinor, carved directly out "
"the rocks with the natural elfish craftsmanship.\n"
"\n"
"    <header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"    They divide into separate houses, and thus were their lords were chosen, "
"each of it commanded by a noble and guided by a cleric.\n"
"\n"
"    They tend to lurking the ever deeps waiting for prey or training "
"fiercely with the cold steel in hand to prepare themselves to any upset that "
"may come enjoying mocking whoever fell captive to them.\n"
"\n"
"    Studied both the arcane as natural arts, Dark Elfs are versatile mages "
"and powerful too.\n"
"\n"
"    Tamed wild animals of the caves too such as lizards and bats, who prove "
"their valour in any battle they enter, serving especially as quick scouts "
"that turn around their enemies, annoying them and distracting them preparing "
"the real assault of the warriors.\n"
"\n"
"    When affronted in their home caves, they are surely a fierce enemy that "
"is not a light tread. Especially with the dwarves they had developed a "
"'special' relationship, and those races will certainly fight until dead when "
"ever they see.\n"
"\n"
"    But outside, against the land dwellers, they quickly will perish "
"especially if not on the covers of the night."
